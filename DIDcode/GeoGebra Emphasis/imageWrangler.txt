Create slider for the number of images you have (free object, increment of 1, I called it "case").

Execute(Sequence("Corner"+i+"=Corner("+i+")",i,1,4)) to create points at the corners of the stage.

Insert your images.  Do not hand label.  If you care about order, change the number at the end of the name (pic1, pic2, etc).

Run the execute Execute(Sequence("ConditionToShowObject(pic"+i+",case=="+i+")",i,1,totalNumberofCases)) so that you only see the image you want in each case.

Make each image the exact height and width you want.

Run the execute Execute(Sequence("Pic"+i+"Width=x(Corner(pic"+i+",3))-x(Corner(pic"+i+",1))",i,1,totalNumberofCases)) to get all of the widths.

Run the execute Execute(Sequence("Pic"+i+"Height=y(Corner(pic"+i+",3))-y(Corner(pic"+i+",1))",i,1,totalNumberofCases)) to get all of the heights.

Create a list of heights and a list of widths.

CopyFreeObject each of those lists. If you don't do this, you get circular definitions. I called mine freeHeight and freeWidth.

Create a currentHeight variable defined as freeHeight(case) and a currentWidth variable defined as freeWidth(case).

Create a polygon for the region in which the point can exist Box=Polygon({Corner1,Corner2-(currentWidth,0),Corner3-(currentWidth,currentHeight),Corner4-(0,currentHeight)}) .

Define each left image point as PointIn(Box).

In "On Update" of each left image point, paste this code and edit to fit appropriately SetCoords(RightPoint,x(LeftPoint)+currentWidth,y(LeftPoint)).
